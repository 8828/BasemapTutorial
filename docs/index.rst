Basemap tutorial
================
Basemap is a great tool for creating simple maps using python. There's some documentation, but some things are a bit more difficult to find. This tutorial will put them together. Since I'm used to use *GDAL*, I'll try to show how to apply some features from *GDAL/OGR* to *Basemap*.
